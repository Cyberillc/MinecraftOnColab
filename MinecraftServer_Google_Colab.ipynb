Its is possible to set one up. Here are some things to take away from this:\n","\n","- **Session Duration**: Google Colab sessions can run for up to 82 hours! but they might turn off the server if the page is inactive for a really long time! To keep your server running (so you players won't be annoyed!) you have to keep your server tab open as much as possible\n","\n","- **Performance Specs**: Google Colab provides around **12 GB** of RAM, a 2.2 GHz processor with 2 threads, which can outperform many paid hosting services. However, it lacks any support from google, so if anything goes wrong you're on your own!\n","\n","- **Mod and Plugin Limitations**: While you can install mods and plugins, it’s advisied to **not** overload the server with too many! As this can impact performance! To reduce this lag try to install a plugin like [LightOptimizer](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/lightoptimizer-%E2%9A%A1-server-performance-booster-fps-helper-%E2%9A%A1.117477/) or a modpack like [1.21 Server Optimizations](https://modrinth.com/collection/YnSBBMnH)\n","\n","- **Best Use Cases**: If you’re planning to make a small Minecraft server for a few players or a smp (btw call it the colab smp XD) this is the perfect option! But, if you are thinking of making a server with more players, i'd recommend you to either buy a server or self host it on an old computer or cheap computer them you upgrade it to make it possible to host a server!.\n"]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
